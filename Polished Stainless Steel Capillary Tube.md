**FAQs**

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316L stainless steel?**
A: 304 stainless steel is widely used for general purposes but lacks the pitting and crevice corrosion resistance found in 316L. 316L contains molybdenum, which enhances its corrosion resistance, making it ideal for applications in chloride-rich environments.

**Q: How do I clean and maintain Polished Stainless Steel Capillary Tubes?**
A: To maintain the polished finish, clean the tubes regularly using mild soap and water. Avoid abrasive cleaners as they can damage the surface. Dry thoroughly after cleaning to prevent water spots.

**Q: Can these tubes be customized?**
A: Yes, we offer customization options including different diameters, wall thicknesses, and lengths. Please contact our sales team for more details.

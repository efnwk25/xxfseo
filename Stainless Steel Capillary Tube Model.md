## FAQs

**Q1: What is the difference between 304 and 304L stainless steel?**
A1: 304 stainless steel is an austenitic chromium-nickel alloy, while 304L is a low-carbon version of 304. The lower carbon content in 304L reduces the risk of intergranular corrosion, making it suitable for applications involving welding.

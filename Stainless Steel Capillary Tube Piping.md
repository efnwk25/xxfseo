## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What is the difference between grade 304 and grade 316 stainless steel?**

A1: Grade 304 stainless steel is the most common type and offers excellent corrosion resistance and formability. Grade 316 stainless steel, on the other hand, contains molybdenum which enhances its resistance to corrosion, especially in chloride environments. It is often preferred in more demanding applications.

**Q2: Can these capillary tubes be customized in terms of length and diameter?**

A2: Yes, we offer customization options for both length and diameter based on your specific requirements. Please contact our sales team for more details.

## FAQs

### Q: What is the difference between 304L and 316L stainless steel?
A: Both grades offer excellent corrosion resistance, but 316L contains molybdenum, which provides even greater resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion. Therefore, 316L is often preferred for applications in harsher environments.

### Q: How do I choose the right diameter and wall thickness?
A: The choice depends on the specific application requirements. For instance, thinner walls are suitable for lower pressure applications, while thicker walls are needed for higher pressure systems. Consult with our technical team for precise recommendations.

### Q: Can these tubes be customized?
A: Absolutely! We offer customization services to meet your exact specifications. Whether you need specific lengths, diameters, or finishes, our team can work with you to create the perfect solution.

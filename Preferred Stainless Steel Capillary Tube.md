## Introduction

Welcome to SD-Steel, your trusted partner in the steel industry. We take pride in offering high-quality products such as our Preferred Stainless Steel Capillary Tubes. These tubes are meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards of durability and performance, making them an essential component for a wide range of applications.

## Product Description

Our Preferred Stainless Steel Capillary Tubes are designed with precision engineering to ensure exceptional quality and reliability. These tubes are made from premium-grade stainless steel, which guarantees superior corrosion resistance and longevity. They are ideal for use in medical devices, analytical instruments, HVAC systems, and other industrial applications where precision and durability are paramount.

## Material

The capillary tubes are manufactured using grade 304 or 316 stainless steel. Both grades offer excellent resistance to corrosion and provide long-lasting performance. Grade 304 is commonly used for general-purpose applications, while grade 316 is preferred for more corrosive environments due to its higher chromium content and molybdenum addition.

| Grade | Composition (%) | Application |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| 304   | Cr: 18-20, Ni: 8-10.5, Mn: 2, Si: 1, Fe: Balance | General Purpose |
| 316   | Cr: 16-18, Ni: 10-14, Mn: 2, Si: 1, Fe: Balance, Mo: 2-3 | Corrosive Environments |

## Specifications & Dimensions

Our capillary tubes come in various sizes to suit different application needs. The following table provides a detailed overview of the available dimensions:

| Diameter (mm) | Wall Thickness (mm) | Length (mm) | Quantity per Box |
